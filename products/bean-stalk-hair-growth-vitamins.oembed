Most times you can get all the vitamins your needs from a balanced diet.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are instances where you need to take supplements in order to achieve a specific purpose.

Vitamins And Herbs Improve Hair Growth \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitamins are much-needed nutrients that keep our bodies' machines working well and herbs have always been a means of delivering these vitamins to our bodies. Vitamin companies may say vitamins are good for you, but the effects of vitamins on hair are often underrepresented.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are vitamins that are specifically good for your hair. This is because they give your hair the required food for growth, vitamins such as Biotin which is sometimes called Vitamin B7 or H. This water-soluble vitamin helps with hair growth and thickening specifically.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only does your hair need vitamins, but you also need minerals to have a system that works well, some of the minerals being zinc and calcium. All of these can be had either through ingesting herbs or taking a vitamin supplement.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. There Are Specifically Formulated Oils For Hair Growth \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA number of vitamin companies will market any and all vitamins to consumers, without specifying which vitamins are specifically good for what. This can at times lead to people buying vitamins that are not right for them, or altogether vitamins that are wrong for them. This happens frequently, but not to despair as we will cover what happens if you get the wrong vitamins and minerals.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help you with not acquiring or ingesting the wrong vitamins, you have to look at what is in the vitamin supplement you are taking. For example, Beanstalk has a 1 per day vitamin solution that is specially formulated to combat hair loss and stimulate hair growth. It is formulated using calcium, b-complex, copper, and a lot of other vitamins essential for the process of hair growth. All of these are excellent to help \u003cstrong\u003efight thinning edges\u003c\/strong\u003e as well.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Chemical Heavy Shampoos Kill Hair \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing shampoos that have a lot of chemicals can kill your hair. This is because these shampoos and the chemicals in them can rob your hair of important vitamins and minerals. In fact, the number of vitamins in these shampoos, are minimal to almost non-existent.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo effectively you are washing out the vitamins every time you take a shower and wash your hair. This is scary, but here’s what we can do.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, you have to get rid of those chemical heavy shampoos. Then you have to implement a hair care system. Look at the \u003cins\u003eBeanstalk range of shampoos\u003c\/ins\u003e. These will make sure to stop leeching vitamins and minerals out of your hair.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there you have to find a means of replenishing those lost vitamins.

When you take vitamins they will ensure you have a very healthy scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of good vitamin supplements with a healthy shampoo, and you will be set for a healthy scalp and thicker hair.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Replenish Your Vitamins Through A Good Diet \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA well-balanced diet is key for you to get vitamins. This is not only for your hair, but for your body as a whole. So in order to make sure you have excellent hair, make sure you have a well-balanced diet. This means that you have to take in food from the 5 food groups.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to help bolster your diet, you can also take vitamin supplements. A good multivitamin would be best and is highly recommended.

The darker side is simply the fact that you can find yourself taking too many vitamins, which could eventually cause more hair loss.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example is biotin, which when taken in recommended doses is great for your hair, but when you take too much for too long, can cause hair loss, skin rashes, and other side effects.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.

Other natural stand alone products to mention for hair growth are fish oil, zinc, and rosemary essential oils.
