Having a dry flaky scalp is at most associated with unhygienic \u003cins\u003ehair care\u003c\/ins\u003e. If you have dandruff, which is caused by and is basically a flaky scalp, people will believe that you do not wash your hair properly or consistently.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes though, it is often the case that you wash it too often. A dry scalp also has the added frustration of itchiness. This ultimately turns into a vicious cycle. You get a dry scalp and itchiness, which causes you to scratch, which creates more irritation, which causes further dry scalp, flaking and itchiness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many possible reasons as to why you may have a dry flaky scalp, and there are many different remedies for it out there.

Most people believe that dandruff and a dry scalp are synonymous, however, there are subtle differences between the two.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not to say that they do not have the same symptoms. Dandruff is mainly caused by a condition that makes your scalp oily, red and scaly, yes scaly.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese scales flake off, resulting in the oily white flakes you see on people with dandruff. A dry scalp, on the other hand, is commonly due to your scalp not having enough moisture. The skin becomes irritated and starts flaking off.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDandruff at most needs a medicated shampoo to remedy the situation, while on the other hand, a dry scalp merely needs rehydration, which you can get with a good \u003cins\u003emoisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eCauses Of A Dry Flaky Scalp \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we know what dandruff is and what a dry scalp is, let us focus on the dry scalp and its causes.

When you are buying a new shampoo, you have to make sure it does not have chemicals that are too harsh for your hair and scalp at all. These chemicals may dry your scalp, and this is mostly when you would end up with a flaky scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, the best thing to do is to make sure that you have a \u003cins\u003emoisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e, to make sure your scalp gets enough moisture, which will keep it healthy.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eFungal Infections \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFungal infections are horrible to have.

Hard water is water that has a high mineral content. It occurs in places where water has passed through high deposits of minerals.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis water is generally safe to drink and use, but if you overexpose your hair to it, it can cause a \u003cstrong\u003edry flaky scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e.
