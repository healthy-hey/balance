I was already using a Hair,Skin and Nails supplement, but I was still losing what felt like 500 strands per day. I may be exaggerating, but that's what it felt like. I'm attributing the hair loss as hormonal ever since I got off birth control. Once I started using this product I did notice the hair loss has subsided. I use four drops altogether. One on top of my scalp, one on each side, and one on the back of my scalp. A little goes a long way. I love the smell which reminds me of lipstick. Probably because of the castor oil. I also like how my hair feels. I can't really tell if it's helping my hair growth because of the supplements I'm taking, but I know the combination of the two is definitely working.
