I was already using a Hair,Skin and Nails supplement, but I was still losing what felt like 500 strands per day. I may be exaggerating, but that's what it felt like. I'm attributing the hair loss as hormonal ever since I got off birth control. Once I started using this product I did notice the hair loss has subsided. I use four drops altogether. One on top of my scalp, one on each side, and one on the back of my scalp. A little goes a long way. I love the smell which reminds me of lipstick. Probably because of the castor oil. I also like how my hair feels. I can't really tell if it's helping my hair growth because of the supplements I'm taking, but I know the combination of the two is definitely working. I'm going to try it for 90 days for maximum results. So far so good.

Having a dry flaky scalp is at most associated with unhygienic \u003cins\u003ehair care\u003c\/ins\u003e. If you have dandruff, which is caused by and is basically a flaky scalp, people will believe that you do not wash your hair properly or consistently.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes though, it is often the case that you wash it too often. A dry scalp also has the added frustration of itchiness. This ultimately turns into a vicious cycle. You get a dry scalp and itchiness, which causes you to scratch, which creates more irritation, which causes further dry scalp, flaking and itchiness.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many possible reasons as to why you may have a dry flaky scalp, and there are many different remedies for it out there. Some say tea tree oil is best, while others recommend a \u003cins\u003egood moisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e as great remedies for this condition.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese remedies are awesome, but before you can remedy the situation, it is best to first find the root cause, and once you deal with the root cause, you will be able to ensure that the dryness does not return.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eDandruff vs Dry Scalp \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you can embark on a journey of treatment for a dry scalp you first have to know the difference between dandruff and a dry scalp. Most people believe that dandruff and a dry scalp are synonymous, however, there are subtle differences between the two.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not to say that they do not have the same symptoms. Dandruff is mainly caused by a condition that makes your scalp oily, red and scaly, yes scaly.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese scales flake off, resulting in the oily white flakes you see on people with dandruff. A dry scalp, on the other hand, is commonly due to your scalp not having enough moisture. The skin becomes irritated and starts flaking off.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDandruff at most needs a medicated shampoo to remedy the situation, while on the other hand, a dry scalp merely needs rehydration, which you can get with a good \u003cins\u003emoisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eCauses Of A Dry Flaky Scalp \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we know what dandruff is and what a dry scalp is, let us focus on the dry scalp and its causes. There are many causes for a dry scalp and we will look at 8 very important causes of a dry flaky scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eShampoo With Harsh Chemicals \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse of a harsh shampoo is one of the leading causes of a dry scalp. When you are buying a new shampoo, you have to make sure it does not have chemicals that are too harsh for your hair and scalp at all. These chemicals may dry your scalp, and this is mostly when you would end up with a flaky scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, the best thing to do is to make sure that you have a \u003cins\u003emoisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e, to make sure your scalp gets enough moisture, which will keep it healthy.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eFungal Infections \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFungal infections are horrible to have. You can get it them on nearly every part of your body. In the case of the scalp, a fungal infection can cause multiple symptoms, the most prevalent being a \u003cstrong\u003edry flaky scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e as well as an \u003cstrong\u003eitchy dry scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do have a fungal infection it is best to go and see a professional, because fungal infections can sometimes spread as you scratch your \u003cstrong\u003epeeling scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e. In this case, you may have to get a \u003cstrong\u003eshampoo for a dry flaky scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e, but one that is specifically formulated to deal with a fungal infection.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eHard Water\u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might be asking yourself what hard water is, and more importantly, whether you’ve exposed your hair to it? Hard water is water that has a high mineral content. It occurs in places where water has passed through high deposits of minerals.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis water is generally safe to drink and use, but if you overexpose your hair to it, it can cause a \u003cstrong\u003edry flaky scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e. Some people rave about using bottled water when they are in areas with hard water. While that may work, it could get expensive.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eAn Unbalanced Diet \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one can't be stressed enough: you are what you eat. Not only that, but it comes out of your pores and hair as well. When you have a balanced diet, your skin and hair will show it.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, there is some evidence supporting your hair as an early warning signal for health problems. In the case of a dry scalp and more importantly a \u003cstrong\u003esevere dry scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e, the main cause may be a bad diet that has left your scalp not only lacking in nutrients but also moisture, resulting in the \u003cstrong\u003edry flaky scalp symptom\u003c\/strong\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eExtreme Weather Conditions \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtreme weather can be detrimental to your hair in more ways than you can believe. Not only do you have to consider the effect of the sun’s rays on your skin and hair, but you also have to consider what effect other conditions such as humidity, and dry air have on your scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey can sometimes rob your scalp of the necessary moisture needed to keep healthy. A \u003cins\u003emoisturizing shampoo\u003c\/ins\u003e should be able to remedy this, with a \u003cins\u003ehair care\u003c\/ins\u003e regimen aimed at nourishing the scalp.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eUsing Too Many Products \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with most things, over processing can cause more harm than good, the same applies to your scalp. If you are using too many styling agents on your hair, and not letting it breathe, or rest, you may find yourself with a \u003cins\u003esevere dry scalp\u003c\/ins\u003e. This is because these styling products do not allow your scalp to naturally moisturize itself. It is best to have a select few hair styling products, and to give your hair and scalp time to rest every so often. This way you will almost always have a healthy scalp and hair.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eBad Hair Care Regimen \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you take care of your scalp, it will take care of you. So you need to have a very good \u003cins\u003ehair care\u003c\/ins\u003e system and process in place. This will let you treat, condition and moisturize your scalp as needed and make sure you do not suffer from a \u003cins\u003edry flaky scalp\u003c\/ins\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003eEczema \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEczema is a condition that causes a dryness of the skin. Your skin may get so dry it looks scaly. There is also a kind of eczema called scalp eczema, where the condition manifests in your scalp. One of its effects is an itchy dry scalp that flakes off, but there are also other worse effects that may occur.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003e8 Ways To Eliminate A Dry Flaky Scalp\u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next question is \u003cstrong\u003ehow do we moisturize our scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e and hair?

A Balanced Diet \u003c\/ins\u003e\u003c\/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe balanced diet is a very good place to start. You can make sure you are healthy from within. This remedy is particularly important if you have not been taking care of what you eat. When you have a balanced diet your scalp will be well nourished, making it less likely to develop into a \u003cstrong\u003edry flaky scalp\u003c\/strong\u003e.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cins\u003e2.

Vitamin companies may say vitamins are good for you, but the effects of vitamins on hair are often underrepresented.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are vitamins that are specifically good for your hair. This is because they give your hair the required food for growth, vitamins such as Biotin which is sometimes called Vitamin B7 or H. This water-soluble vitamin helps with hair growth and thickening specifically.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only does your hair need vitamins, but you also need minerals to have a system that works well, some of the minerals being zinc and calcium.

This can at times lead to people buying vitamins that are not right for them, or altogether vitamins that are wrong for them. This happens frequently, but not to despair as we will cover what happens if you get the wrong vitamins and minerals.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help you with not acquiring or ingesting the wrong vitamins, you have to look at what is in the vitamin supplement you are taking.

It is formulated using calcium, b-complex, copper, and a lot of other vitamins essential for the process of hair growth.

In fact, the number of vitamins in these shampoos, are minimal to almost non-existent.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo effectively you are washing out the vitamins every time you take a shower and wash your hair.

One on top of my scalp, one on each side, and one on the back of my scalp. A little goes a long way. I love the smell which reminds me of lipstick. Probably because of the castor oil. I also like how my hair feels. I can't really tell if it's helping my hair growth because of the supplements I'm taking, but I know the combination of the two is definitely working.
