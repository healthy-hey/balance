<h3><em>When We Created This Product For You We Never Would Have Guessed What Would happen:</em></h3>
<p>We were able to display your results to the world. While you proving against all odds, that you were able to reclaim your crown and glory. We have read testimonials where customers have walked into their Dermatologist's office, just to say "Hello" and see the look on his face, when they told him they grow their hair back. This is not a wig... <strong>THIS IS MY HAIR! #Power</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em>There is Nothing More Sexy &amp; Beautiful Than A Confident Woman </em></h3>
<p>We have all seen her (you are probably looking at her right now in the mirror) running her fingers through her hair as she looks over her shoulder at the men in the room, staring back at her. Our hair has always been a source of power, prestige and attractiveness. BeanStalk is happy being your secret weapon.<strong> #WeSlay</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em></em></h3>
<h3><em></em></h3>
<h3><em></em></h3>
<h3><em>Then There Is The Mother-Daughter Stories:</em></h3>
<p>Mothers, grandmothers and aunties use our product to change their daughter, grand daughters and niece's life at school. We all know how mean, children can be at school and after using the product on the child's hair over the summer, her BACK TO SCHOOL Show Case was AWESOME. Mother's become<strong> #1 Moms</strong>. Grandmothers become <strong>#1 Grandmas</strong> and Aunties become <strong>"My FAVORITE AUNTIE IN THE WHOLE WORLD"</strong> This is why we work hard to deliver such an amazing product to all of you.</p>
<h3><em></em></h3>
<h3><em>"Tracy......"</em></h3>
<p>We all know Tracy’s story of walking down the Miami strip, with this<strong> beauty yellow maxi dress</strong> on, <strong>turning heads</strong> and gaining attention. As a strong wind blew, Tracy held her dress in place and began to feel the wind on her head. As she looked around, and placed her hand on her head, she <em><strong>noticed her wig was missing</strong></em>. (Thinning edges had caused to her pin the wig further and further back on her head).  She felt the <span><strong>shock of that moment tear into her chest</strong></span>, as she turned and saw it laying behind her on the ground.  She could also see the look of shock, on the faces of the same people, who were gawking over her. Overcome with emotion she flagged down a cab and <em><strong>cried her way home</strong></em>.</p>
<p>With<strong> BeanStalk</strong>, this is something you don’t have to experience. Any woman would <strong>gladly pay $165.00</strong>, let alone $64.97 to avoid reliving Tracy’s nightmare.  <span>Thankfully you won’t, now that you have BeanStalk in your life.</span></p>

Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.</p>
<p>The body has different types of hair, including <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair" target="_blank" title="Vellus hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">vellus hair</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_hair" target="_blank" title="Androgenic hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">androgenic hair</a>, each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection. Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.</p>

<h3>8 Ways To Eliminate A Dry Flaky Scalp</h3>
<h4>There are no two ways about it, a flaky scalp sucks.</h4>
<p>If you are afflicted by this condition, then you obviously know how bad it can get. Having a dry flaky scalp is at most associated with unhygienic <ins>hair care</ins>. If you have dandruff, which is caused by and is basically a flaky scalp, people will believe that you do not wash your hair properly or consistently.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, it is often the case that you wash it too often. A dry scalp also has the added frustration of itchiness. This ultimately turns into a vicious cycle. You get a dry scalp and itchiness, which causes you to scratch, which creates more irritation, which causes further dry scalp, flaking and itchiness.</p>
<p>There are many possible reasons as to why you may have a dry flaky scalp, and there are many different remedies for it out there. Some say tea tree oil is best, while others recommend a <ins>good moisturizing shampoo</ins> as great remedies for this condition.</p>
<p>These remedies are awesome, but before you can remedy the situation, it is best to first find the root cause, and once you deal with the root cause, you will be able to ensure that the dryness does not return.</p>
<h4><ins>Dandruff vs Dry Scalp </ins></h4>
<p>Before you can embark on a journey of treatment for a dry scalp you first have to know the difference between dandruff and a dry scalp. Most people believe that dandruff and a dry scalp are synonymous, however, there are subtle differences between the two.</p>
<p>This is not to say that they do not have the same symptoms. Dandruff is mainly caused by a condition that makes your scalp oily, red and scaly, yes scaly.</p>
<p>These scales flake off, resulting in the oily white flakes you see on people with dandruff. A dry scalp, on the other hand, is commonly due to your scalp not having enough moisture. The skin becomes irritated and starts flaking off.</p>
<p>Dandruff at most needs a medicated shampoo to remedy the situation, while on the other hand, a dry scalp merely needs rehydration, which you can get with a good <ins>moisturizing shampoo</ins>.</p>
<h4><ins>Causes Of A Dry Flaky Scalp </ins></h4>
<p>Now that we know what dandruff is and what a dry scalp is, let us focus on the dry scalp and its causes. There are many causes for a dry scalp and we will look at 8 very important causes of a dry flaky scalp.</p>
<h4><ins>Shampoo With Harsh Chemicals </ins></h4>
<p>Use of a harsh shampoo is one of the leading causes of a dry scalp. When you are buying a new shampoo, you have to make sure it does not have chemicals that are too harsh for your hair and scalp at all. These chemicals may dry your scalp, and this is mostly when you would end up with a flaky scalp.</p>
<p>In this case, the best thing to do is to make sure that you have a <ins>moisturizing shampoo</ins>, to make sure your scalp gets enough moisture, which will keep it healthy.</p>
<h4><ins>Fungal Infections </ins></h4>
<p>Fungal infections are horrible to have. You can get it them on nearly every part of your body. In the case of the scalp, a fungal infection can cause multiple symptoms, the most prevalent being a <strong>dry flaky scalp</strong> as well as an <strong>itchy dry scalp</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do have a fungal infection it is best to go and see a professional, because fungal infections can sometimes spread as you scratch your <strong>peeling scalp</strong>. In this case, you may have to get a <strong>shampoo for a dry flaky scalp</strong>, but one that is specifically formulated to deal with a fungal infection.</p>
<h4><ins>Hard Water</ins></h4>
<p>You might be asking yourself what hard water is, and more importantly, whether you’ve exposed your hair to it? Hard water is water that has a high mineral content. It occurs in places where water has passed through high deposits of minerals.</p>
<p>This water is generally safe to drink and use, but if you overexpose your hair to it, it can cause a <strong>dry flaky scalp</strong>. Some people rave about using bottled water when they are in areas with hard water. While that may work, it could get expensive.</p>
<h4><ins>An Unbalanced Diet </ins></h4>
<p>This one can't be stressed enough: you are what you eat. Not only that, but it comes out of your pores and hair as well. When you have a balanced diet, your skin and hair will show it.</p>
<p>In fact, there is some evidence supporting your hair as an early warning signal for health problems. In the case of a dry scalp and more importantly a <strong>severe dry scalp</strong>, the main cause may be a bad diet that has left your scalp not only lacking in nutrients but also moisture, resulting in the <strong>dry flaky scalp symptom</strong>.</p>
<h4><ins>Extreme Weather Conditions </ins></h4>
<p>Extreme weather can be detrimental to your hair in more ways than you can believe. Not only do you have to consider the effect of the sun’s rays on your skin and hair, but you also have to consider what effect other conditions such as humidity, and dry air have on your scalp.</p>
<p>They can sometimes rob your scalp of the necessary moisture needed to keep healthy. A <ins>moisturizing shampoo</ins> should be able to remedy this, with a <ins>hair care</ins> regimen aimed at nourishing the scalp.</p>
<h4><ins>Using Too Many Products </ins></h4>
<p>As with most things, over processing can cause more harm than good, the same applies to your scalp. If you are using too many styling agents on your hair, and not letting it breathe, or rest, you may find yourself with a <ins>severe dry scalp</ins>. This is because these styling products do not allow your scalp to naturally moisturize itself. It is best to have a select few hair styling products, and to give your hair and scalp time to rest every so often. This way you will almost always have a healthy scalp and hair.</p>
<h4><ins>Bad Hair Care Regimen </ins></h4>
<p>If you take care of your scalp, it will take care of you. So you need to have a very good <ins>hair care</ins> system and process in place. This will let you treat, condition and moisturize your scalp as needed and make sure you do not suffer from a <ins>dry flaky scalp</ins>.</p>
<h4><ins>Eczema </ins></h4>
<p>Eczema is a condition that causes a dryness of the skin. Your skin may get so dry it looks scaly. There is also a kind of eczema called scalp eczema, where the condition manifests in your scalp. One of its effects is an itchy dry scalp that flakes off, but there are also other worse effects that may occur.</p>
<h4><ins>8 Ways To Eliminate A Dry Flaky Scalp</ins></h4>
<p>The next question is <strong>how do we moisturize our scalp</strong> and hair? How do you eliminate a dry flaky scalp?</p>
<h4><ins>1. A Balanced Diet </ins></h4>
<p>The balanced diet is a very good place to start. You can make sure you are healthy from within. This remedy is particularly important if you have not been taking care of what you eat. When you have a balanced diet your scalp will be well nourished, making it less likely to develop into a <strong>dry flaky scalp</strong>.</p>
<h4><ins>2. Shampoo For Eczema </ins></h4>
<p>As we mentioned, eczema is a skin condition that causes your skin to dry out and look scaly. When it comes to scalp eczema you should go to a professional dermatologist so as to get a recommended shampoo for eczema. Beanstalk has a great range of natural shampoos and conditioners that will help in most cases of a <strong>dry flaky scalp</strong>.</p>
<h4><ins>3. Get And Use A Well-Formulated Shampoo System </ins></h4>
<p>One of the causes of a dry flaky scalp is shampoo that is too harsh on your hair. You need to use a shampoo system that will not only wash your hair but will care for it too. Look for a range of shampoos that will wash and condition your hair.</p>
<p>Beanstalk has a range of <ins>moisturizing shampoos</ins> that include a detox for your hair. After washing your hair you can then detox it to make sure it gets the rest it needs from constant chemicals. You can then condition your hair to make sure it is well taken care off. With <ins>Beanstalk’s Shampoo, Detox Shampoo, and Conditioner Package</ins> you will not only improve hair growth but you will also ensure a healthy scalp.</p>
<h4><ins>4. Lemon Juice </ins></h4>
<p>Lemon is an excellent home remedy for a dry flaky scalp. Not only will the lemon juice control the pH of the scalp, but it will also work to get rid of fungal infections. All you have to do is gently rub the lemon juice into your scalp and leave it for 5 minutes before rinsing it out.</p>
<h4><ins>5. Mayonnaise </ins></h4>
<p>Apply mayonnaise to your scalp and cover your head. Leave this in for 15 to 20 minutes. Rinse it out and then shampoo normally using the shampoo and conditioner package from Beanstalk. This should be done once a week and will help nourish and condition your hair.</p>
<h4><ins>6. Use Beanstalk Infusion </ins></h4>
<p>Not only does this product fight thinning hair edges and improve hair growth, but it will also fight a <strong>severe dry scalp</strong>. It does this by moisturizing your scalp and <ins>stimulating hair growth</ins>. It is fully plant-based and strengthens damaged hair to boot. You only need to apply it once a day for 10 minutes. That is all you have to do and no more dry flaky scalp.</p>
<h4><ins>7. Onion Juice</ins></h4>
<p>For this one, you need a quarter cup of onion juice, honey, and cotton. Once you have gotten all the products together you should mix the honey and onion juice together and use the cotton to apply to your scalp. Let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes and shampoo as per normal. This should be done twice weekly for best results.</p>
<h4><ins>8. Have A Hair Care System And Regimen And Stick To It. </ins></h4>
<p>To get the best results you have to use the best products. Beanstalk’s system is the best out there. It includes Beanstalk’s oil infusion, hair growth vitamins, and their shampoo system all in one. Use this as your <ins>hair care</ins> regimen and you will not only have healthy hair but a healthy scalp as well. The <strong>moisturizing shampoo</strong> along with the vitamins and oil infusion will ensure you get the results you want.</p>
<p>In conclusion there are many reasons as to why you may have a dry flaky scalp. These can be anything from the kind of water you use to wash your hair to even the chemicals you use on your hair. There are also many remedies on the market and a few home remedies for you to choose from.</p>
<p>That being said it is always much better to first find the cause of the dry scalp and then remedy, because if you keep treating the symptoms and not the cause you may find yourself stuck in a cycle of irritation, remedy, relief, and repeat.</p>
<p>In summary, in this article we have covered some causes of a dry flaky scalp. These were using a bad diet, harsh shampoos, fungal infections, extreme weather condition, as well as eczema to name a few. We also looked at possible solutions to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Eczema shampoo</strong>, correcting one’s diet, a <strong>good moisturizing shampoo, and</strong> <ins>Beanstalk’s family of hair care products</ins>, were some of the 8 ways to eliminate a dry flaky scalp. Using a <ins>hair care</ins> system particularly one that has a <strong>shampoo for a dry flaky scalp</strong> is a great way to go. Add this onto a vitamin regimen that will also help your hair grow and you have a winning formula to eliminate a dry flaky scalp.</p>

<h3>10 Things Hair Growth Vitamin Companies will Never Tell YOU!</h3>
<h5>Vitamin A, B, D, L, M, A, O…</h5>
<p>Every day we hear about a new vitamin or mineral that we need to have in order to keep being healthy. But do we actually know what vitamins are? Or what they actually do?</p>
<p><strong>What vitamins are good for your hair?</strong> All of these are pertinent questions when one considers how to take care of one’s hair. There are many products on the market that promise the world, but don’t deliver anything. So how can we navigate the pitfalls of the vitamin industry?</p>
<p>To make this that much easier for this article, we will take a look at the 10 things hair growth vitamin companies will never tell you. Some of these you will believe, some you will be surprised by, and some you would never even have guessed.</p>
<p>There are many reasons people use vitamins. Many use them for hair growth and there are even specific <strong>vitamins for thinning hair.</strong></p>
<p>Before we dive into the <strong>10 things hair growth vitamin companies will never tell you,</strong> we need to first find out what vitamins are as well as the effects of vitamins on hair. We will look at the following 10 secrets of hair growth vitamin companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>vitamins and herbs improve hair growth</li>
<li>there are specifically formulated oils for hair growth</li>
<li>take supplements to protect hair roots from inflammation</li>
<li>chemical heavy shampoos kill hair</li>
<li>replenish your vitamins through a good diet.</li>
<li>price is not that important</li>
<li>some vitamins and minerals can cause hair loss</li>
<li>regulated or not regulated</li>
<li>do vitamins and supplements help hair growth</li>
<li>the best hair growth vitamins</li>
</ul>
<h5>What Are Vitamins?</h5>
<p>Media has a lot to say about vitamins and minerals. Yet many people do not really know what vitamins and minerals are. Vitamins are nutrients that your body needs in order to function properly. Most times you can get all the vitamins your needs from a balanced diet.</p>
<p>However, there are instances where you need to take supplements in order to achieve a specific purpose. This being, to either take in the recommended level of vitamins, or to improve your health, which is optimally the best of them all, or the option of taking <strong>vitamins for hair growth and thickness.</strong></p>
<h5>How Vitamin Deficiency Can Affect Your Hair ?</h5>
<p>Vitamin deficiency can cause many problems within your body. This is also true of your hair. If you have a vitamin deficiency you may develop telogen effluvium, which is a form of alopecia, however it is a non-scarring form, and is characterized by diffuse hair shedding.</p>
<p>This condition causes your hair to stop growing and to start resting. This may be detrimental in that it makes your hair weak as well. So the question then is <strong>what vitamins are good for fast hair growth.</strong> <ins>Beanstalk's hair growth vitamins</ins> are a quick and easy means to get all the vitamins your hair needs to grow long and strong. This one per day formula is perfect as a black hair vitamin, and will also help fight thinning edges.</p>
<p>Having laid the groundwork, and now that we know what vitamins are and how important they are, let us look at 10 things hair growth vitamin companies will never tell you.</p>
<p><strong>1. Vitamins And Herbs Improve Hair Growth </strong></p>
<p>Vitamins are much-needed nutrients that keep our bodies' machines working well and herbs have always been a means of delivering these vitamins to our bodies. Vitamin companies may say vitamins are good for you, but the effects of vitamins on hair are often underrepresented.</p>
<p>There are vitamins that are specifically good for your hair. This is because they give your hair the required food for growth, vitamins such as Biotin which is sometimes called Vitamin B7 or H. This water-soluble vitamin helps with hair growth and thickening specifically.</p>
<p>Not only does your hair need vitamins, but you also need minerals to have a system that works well, some of the minerals being zinc and calcium. All of these can be had either through ingesting herbs or taking a vitamin supplement.</p>
<p><strong>2. There Are Specifically Formulated Oils For Hair Growth </strong></p>
<p>A number of vitamin companies will market any and all vitamins to consumers, without specifying which vitamins are specifically good for what. This can at times lead to people buying vitamins that are not right for them, or altogether vitamins that are wrong for them. This happens frequently, but not to despair as we will cover what happens if you get the wrong vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>To help you with not acquiring or ingesting the wrong vitamins, you have to look at what is in the vitamin supplement you are taking. For example, Beanstalk has a 1 per day vitamin solution that is specially formulated to combat hair loss and stimulate hair growth. It is formulated using calcium, b-complex, copper, and a lot of other vitamins essential for the process of hair growth. All of these are excellent to help <strong>fight thinning edges</strong> as well.</p>
<p><strong>3. Chemical Heavy Shampoos Kill Hair </strong></p>
<p>Using shampoos that have a lot of chemicals can kill your hair. This is because these shampoos and the chemicals in them can rob your hair of important vitamins and minerals. In fact, the number of vitamins in these shampoos, are minimal to almost non-existent.</p>
<p>So effectively you are washing out the vitamins every time you take a shower and wash your hair. This is scary, but here’s what we can do.</p>
<p>First, you have to get rid of those chemical heavy shampoos. Then you have to implement a hair care system. Look at the <ins>Beanstalk range of shampoos</ins>. These will make sure to stop leeching vitamins and minerals out of your hair.</p>
<p>From there you have to find a means of replenishing those lost vitamins. Beanstalk has the <ins>Beanstalk Oil Infusion</ins>, <ins>Hair Growth Vitamins</ins> &amp; <ins>Shampoo System</ins>. This system will not only give you a natural and great way to keep your hair clean, but it will also be healthy and have balanced vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p><strong>4. Take Supplements To Protect Hair Roots From Inflammation </strong></p>
<p>You need to take supplements in order to protect your hair. Supplements can be used to protect your hair roots from inflammation. Inflammation can cause you to have a dry flaky scalp. This may even lead to dandruff. When you take vitamins they will ensure you have a very healthy scalp.</p>
<p>A couple of good vitamin supplements with a healthy shampoo, and you will be set for a healthy scalp and thicker hair.</p>
<p><strong>5. Replenish Your Vitamins Through A Good Diet </strong></p>
<p>A well-balanced diet is key for you to get vitamins. This is not only for your hair, but for your body as a whole. So in order to make sure you have excellent hair, make sure you have a well-balanced diet. This means that you have to take in food from the 5 food groups.</p>
<p>In order to help bolster your diet, you can also take vitamin supplements. A good multivitamin would be best and is highly recommended. These usually have all the nutrients you will need and if you take one, formulated towards hair growth you will be able to reap those benefits as well.</p>
<p><strong>6. Price Is Not That Important </strong></p>
<p>There is this culture of, more expensive is always best. This is not always the case. Many times a cheaper option is just as good if not better than one that is much more expensive.</p>
<p>Take for example Beanstalk’s hair growth vitamin range. It is cheap, but it has everything your body will need to give you healthy, luscious and strong hair. So shopping for <strong><ins>hair growth vitamins at Beanstalk</ins></strong> is not a bad thing. In fact, it could be the best thing for you.</p>
<p><strong>7. Regulated Or Not Regulated </strong></p>
<p>It is often times assumed that if you buy a product, such as a vitamin supplement, then it has to be regulated. Well, this is not always true. Whether you choose to take a <strong>vitamin for hair growth and thickness,</strong> or even if you are looking at getting <strong>vitamins for thinning hair</strong> you have to make sure they are regulated and approved. So as to get the best results, such as the Beanstalk one a day hair growth vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>8. Some Vitamins And Minerals Can Cause Hair Loss </strong></p>
<p>We cannot mention taking vitamins, without mentioning the darker side. The darker side is simply the fact that you can find yourself taking too many vitamins, which could eventually cause more hair loss.</p>
<p>An example is biotin, which when taken in recommended doses is great for your hair, but when you take too much for too long, can cause hair loss, skin rashes, and other side effects.</p>
<p><strong>9. The Best Hair Growth Vitamins</strong></p>
<p>So what are the best hair vitamins for faster hair growth? What can you take in order to have thicker, fuller hair?</p>
<p>BeanStalk’s specially formulated one a day formula is an <ins>excellent vitamin for hair</ins>, that you can take to make sure you have great hair.</p>
<p>It will not only help you get thicker hair, but will also actively fight hair loss. Other natural stand alone products to mention for hair growth are fish oil, zinc, and rosemary essential oils. However, although these in themselves are great, it is best to have a regulated, proven product to aid in your hair growth.</p>
<p><strong>10. Do Vitamins And Supplements Help Hair Growth </strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question is a resounding yes. Vitamins and supplements definitely help with hair growth. People who have taken the BeanStalk hair growth vitamins report richer, stronger, thicker hair and these are people who have tried other products in the past, and have had no success. This is definitely a product that helps. Try it out and see how well it will work for you.</p>
<p>To re-iterate the points we’ve mentioned earlier. There are many reasons for hair loss and thinning edges. Vitamins and minerals are extremely important for hair growth, but it should be mentioned that not all vitamins and minerals are good for your hair.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is extremely important you read what is in your vitamin of choice. You have to look out for the <strong>best hair vitamins for faster hair growth</strong> like the Beanstalk range of products. They are formulated to give your hair the perfectly balanced vitamins and nutrients, so as to stimulate hair to grow. They also have <strong>vitamins for thinning hair.</strong></p>
<p>With these 10 things hair growth vitamin companies will never tell you, you are armed with just the right knowledge to get the <strong>best natural vitamins for hair growth</strong> out there.</p>

<p>I actually bought this for my son, he was going bald and I just thought that I would give this a try because the dermatologist had no answers for him. I massaged it into his skin every night before bed. I tried one side at a time to see if I could tell any difference and lo and behold, he started growing hair.

<p>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I can definitely see some hair growth in the middle of my hair where there was very little before. It also makes my hair very soft. I am loving it. I plan on placing another order this week!</p>

<p>I love this stuff so far, I'm African American and have 3b/3c hair type and last year i ruined my hair with a relaxer and Keratin treatment all at once including using a blow dryer &amp; flat iron, after two weeks of this my hair was total crap and the natural curl pattern refuse to come back, since buying the bean stalk hair treatment and using it for about a month now my hair has come back to life and my curls are back,will continue to use this product, also this has made my hair grow a little bit since using it as well, not sure how much growth, do recommend to anyone looking to restore their hair due to chemical styling,this a real review, purchased this product with my own money and buy this again :-)</p>

<p>okay so I've only been using this for a few weeks now, but i will say i only have positive remarks. i shaved my sides, and i HATE IT. so I'm using this to grow it back, and i think its growing faster because I'm using this product.</p>

<p>I am LOVING this stuff. I don't have thinning hair, but do use a high lift blonde to lighten every 4 to 5 weeks on my roots. Any lifting of color can be very damaging &amp; can irritate the scalp, so this has been a big help in maintaining my the health of both my hair &amp; sensitive scalp.I have also noticed my roots are showing sooner than usual, which shows the effectiveness of this product for hair growth. I also am impressed by the natural ingredients. I am super sensitive to so many hair products and have so much trouble finding natural hair products without all the chemicals and fragrance that irritate my eczema or give me a hives rash.This one has proved to be chemical free with minimal scent.The only scent i can pick up is a slight castor oil smell that is fine by me because that is natural. I am very HAPPY &amp; am about to order my second bottle!!!!</p>

<p>I started using this product to help assist with hair loss. I was already using a Hair,Skin and Nails supplement, but I was still losing what felt like 500 strands per day. I may be exaggerating, but that's what it felt like. I'm attributing the hair loss as hormonal ever since I got off birth control. Once I started using this product I did notice the hair loss has subsided. I use four drops altogether. One on top of my scalp, one on each side, and one on the back of my scalp. A little goes a long way. I love the smell which reminds me of lipstick. Probably because of the castor oil. I also like how my hair feels. I can't really tell if it's helping my hair growth because of the supplements I'm taking, but I know the combination of the two is definitely working. I'm going to try it for 90 days for maximum results. So far so good. I would definitely recommend this product.</p>

<p><span>Ok.. I was a bid discouraged after I ordered this product. All the reviews I saw on u tube were from the black community. I wast sure it would work on Caucasian hair.. but I swear on my life my hair has grown an inch in 2 weeks. New hair growth were it was thinning. . This product is amazing amazing I would recommend to anyone. I'm 29 I just had a baby and my hair was falling out all over the place I mean hand fulls in the shower. I'm barley loosing any hair in the shower now. Now because of the oily texture of this product I can't wear it out during the day. But I put it in at night and leave it in until I take a shower and I was surprised how easy it was to wash out.. I know lots of mom that loose hair after a baby. I'm telling all of my friends about this.. it's a life changer for sure</span></p>

<p><span>I used this product on my fiance's hair. He has a area in the front of his head that has been slowly thinning. After 3 weeks of using this 3-4 times a week his thin spot has almost filled in, almost looks like the rest of his thick coarse hair. Just make sure you water and massage your scalp daily.</span></p>

Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.</p>
<p>The body has different types of hair, including <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair" target="_blank" title="Vellus hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">vellus hair</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_hair" target="_blank" title="Androgenic hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">androgenic hair</a>, each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection. Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.</p>

<p>I am LOVING this stuff. I don't have thinning hair, but do use a high lift blonde to lighten every 4 to 5 weeks on my roots. Any lifting of color can be very damaging &amp; can irritate the scalp, so this has been a big help in maintaining my the health of both my hair &amp; sensitive scalp.I have also noticed my roots are showing sooner than usual, which shows the effectiveness of this product for hair growth. I also am impressed by the natural ingredients. I am super sensitive to so many hair products and have so much trouble finding natural hair products without all the chemicals and fragrance that irritate my eczema or give me a hives rash.This one has proved to be chemical free with minimal scent.The only scent i can pick up is a slight castor oil smell that is fine by me because that is natural. I am very HAPPY &amp; am about to order my second bottle!!!!</p>

<p>I started using this product to help assist with hair loss. I was already using a Hair,Skin and Nails supplement, but I was still losing what felt like 500 strands per day. I may be exaggerating, but that's what it felt like. I'm attributing the hair loss as hormonal ever since I got off birth control. Once I started using this product I did notice the hair loss has subsided. I use four drops altogether. One on top of my scalp, one on each side, and one on the back of my scalp. A little goes a long way. I love the smell which reminds me of lipstick. Probably because of the castor oil. I also like how my hair feels. I can't really tell if it's helping my hair growth because of the supplements I'm taking, but I know the combination of the two is definitely working. I'm going to try it for 90 days for maximum results. So far so good. I would definitely recommend this product.</p>

<p><span>Ok.. I was a bid discouraged after I ordered this product. All the reviews I saw on u tube were from the black community. I wast sure it would work on Caucasian hair.. but I swear on my life my hair has grown an inch in 2 weeks. New hair growth were it was thinning. . This product is amazing amazing I would recommend to anyone. I'm 29 I just had a baby and my hair was falling out all over the place I mean hand fulls in the shower. I'm barley loosing any hair in the shower now. Now because of the oily texture of this product I can't wear it out during the day. But I put it in at night and leave it in until I take a shower and I was surprised how easy it was to wash out.. I know lots of mom that loose hair after a baby. I'm telling all of my friends about this.. it's a life changer for sure</span></p>

<h1 class="accordion-section"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thinning Edges - 7 Growth Secrets No One Talks About</strong></span></h1>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>To many, a thick growth of hair is a sign of virility and beauty. It is the mane that crowns us. It is also the most adaptable accessory that you can own. Not only does it serve an aesthetic function, but it is also an indicator of health. Weak and breaking hair is sometimes attributed to mineral deficiencies.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>If your hair is falling out in clumps then you know there is a serious problem that needs dealing with. The thought of losing your hair is without doubt a most debilitating thing to deal with. <a href="http://www.beanstalkhairgrowth.com" target="_blank" title="Beanstalk Hair loss solution" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hair loss</a> is usually associated with old age, being feeble, and honestly just one strand closer to death. Yet hair loss is very natural, and for many men, it is just another step in their development and maturity.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>What are the causes of hair loss? Hair loss is the product of either genetics or behavior. For men, as they age they become more sensitive to androgens. These are the male sex hormones. These hormones basically make male sex organs look the way they do.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>This hypersensitivity to these hormones is the genetic cause of hair loss in men. This is not something you can change. The behavior, on the other hand, is caused by constant stress on your hair caused by hairstyles that pull your hair.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Cornrows, braids, ponytails and any other hairstyle that pulls your hair can cause what is known as traction alopecia. So yes you can get <strong>hair loss due to weaves</strong>. We will discuss what you can do to stop this condition and to reverse hair loss caused by it.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>In order to <strong>fix thinning edges</strong>, we will look at 7 growth secrets no talks about when discussing thinning edges. So if you have ever asked yourself: <strong>How do I grow hairline back</strong>, then this is the article for you. There is a multitude of supposed remedies for <strong>thinning hair around the edges</strong>.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>These are either behavioral, medicinal or require the use of oils. Many people swear by Emu oil and coconut oil for edges. We will look at some of the best-kept secrets for <strong>preventing thinning edges</strong>.</div>
<h2 class="accordion-section">
<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secret 1: Duck And Weave Away From The Weave</span></strong>
</h2>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Well, not just the weave. Basically, if you don't want your hairline running away from your face then you should keep away from hair styles that put your hair into traction. There are some commonly held misconceptions around alopecia.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>The most prevalent one being, your hair has to be pulled very hard for a long time in order for this condition to develop. The truth however is that you don't need to be dragged around by your hair in order to start getting thinning edges.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Hairstyles such as dreads, cornrows, ponytails and yes even the weave can cause this to happen. Sad to say but you can get <strong>hair loss after a weave</strong>. Even hairstyles like braids which are supposed to be protective against thinning edges can be one of the causes of thinning edges.</div>
<div class="accordion-section"></div>
<div class="accordion-section">If your hair stylist pulls too hard on your edges you could soon find yourself with luscious hair and barren plain where your hairline used to be.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>A recommended approach for those that can't live without their weave is to give your hair a rest every now and then. Let your hair free for a few months and you will be surprised by the results. Do that and combine it with some of the other secrets on here, and you will be on your way to thick beautiful edges again.</div>
<div class="accordion-section"></div>
<h3 class="accordion-section"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secret 2: Your Pillow Could Be Thinning Your Edges Faster.</strong></span></h3>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>If you use a cotton pillow then it could be another cause of your thinning edges. Cotton can be a little rough on your edges. It can cause chaffing of your edges and therefore cause more damage.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>The friction caused by your cotton pillow rubbing on your hair seems insignificant, but compounded over time it can be a threat to your already thinning edges.<br>So what can you do? What is a <strong>thinning edges</strong> solution when your pillow is the enemy?</div>
<div class="accordion-section"></div>
<div class="accordion-section">Well, some say that satin is a much better fabric for you to sleep on.<br>This is because it is thin, soft and there is little friction when it comes to hair on satin. This may seem a bit drastic for some but it is worth it to <strong>strengthen thinning edges.</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordion-section"></div>
<h4 class="accordion-section"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Secret 3: Emu Oil Stimulates Hair Growth And Can Help To Regrow Damaged Edges</strong></span></h4>

It is said to be highly effective to the point of taking only 30 days for visible results to be seen.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>This oil is derived from the Emu, a large flightless bird from Australia, basically the ostrich’s smaller cousin. It is refined from the Emu meat, which is supposed to be a leaner alternative to beef. Because the oil is refined, you don’t have to fear that you will smell like roasted emu when you use it.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br><strong>Is Emu oil good for your hair?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>There are reports that Australia’s aboriginal people used emu oil to care of wounds, and a whole laundry list of other uses. Hair growth being one of those. The oil is supposed to stimulate more hair growth in less than 30 days.</div>

</h6>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>There are those who are in the natural hair movement, and then there are those who choose to relax or perm their hair. Others are in transition from one to the other. No matter where you are, you need to give your hair time to breathe.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Stretch out periods between your relaxing sessions. If you add relaxer to already relaxed hair you may be weakening your hair and actually causing it to fray and thin, and this may even lead to greater hair loss. So you find yourself wanting thicker hair but getting thinner frayed edges.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>The thinning edges on relaxed hair can be caused by not properly taking care of your hair between and during relaxing sessions. First and foremost give your hair ample time to grow between sessions so you do not overlap on relaxing solutions.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Next, make sure to protect your hair when you go in to have it relaxed. When you relax or <strong>perm thinning edges</strong> make sure to protect them. You can use coconut oil as a pre-shampoo to protect your cuticles. Use protein treatments weekly so as to help thicken your hair and to <strong>strengthen thinning edges</strong>. Add this to your hair care regimen and you have a winner.</div>

<br>These are just a few of the secrets to help keep your hair thick, both on your crown as well as at your edges. Hair loss affects nearly 60% of men and more than 40% of women. This may be because of genetics.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Until we have genetic manipulation down to an art, there is nothing you can do to remedy your genes. The other known cause is family disposition. If your family has a history of baldness, then you may have something to worry about. Which is why you should take <a href="http://www,beanstalkhairgrowth.com" target="_blank" title="BeanStalk Hair Loss Secrets" rel="noopener noreferrer">these hair loss secrets</a> not many talk about serious, and see what works for you.</div>
<div class="accordion-section"></div>
<div class="accordion-section">Most often prevention is better than cure. This is also true when it comes to <a href="http://www.beanstalkhairgrowth.com" target="_blank" title="BeanStalk Hair Loss Products" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair loss</a>. So don't wait until your hairline reaches the top of your head to use them. Some of these only require you to change a small habit.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Using braids, weaves, cornrows, and dreads less often is a good start. Don't join the likes of Ms. Campbell in her hair woes. Take the traction off your hair and let your hair rest once in a while.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>Moisturize and make sure your hair is nourished as much as possible. Nourish it with the right products. A healthy diet is not only good for you but your hair as well. These will all help to <strong>strengthen thinning edges.</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>If you look after your hair just like you look after every other body part, it will stay with you as long as possible. A recurring theme no matter the hairstyle is giving your hair time to breathe and rest.</div>
<div class="accordion-section">
<br>This will go a very long way to ensure those thick locks will have full body and beautiful edges. Short of an actual crown, your hair is the most beautiful thing you can have on your head.</div>

(Thinning had caused to her pin the wig further and further back on her head).  She felt the <span><strong>shock of that moment tear into her chest</strong></span>, as she turned and saw it laying behind her on the ground.  She could also see the look of shock, on the faces of the same people, who were gawking over her.

<p>The <b>growth of human hair</b> occurs everywhere on the body except for the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_(foot)" target="_blank" title="Sole (foot)" rel="noopener noreferrer">soles of the feet</a>, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip" target="_blank" title="Lip (mouth)" rel="noopener noreferrer">lips</a>, palms of the hands, some external <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ" target="_blank" title="Genitals" rel="noopener noreferrer">genital</a> areas, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navel" title="Navel">navel</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar" title="Scar">scar</a> tissue, and, apart from <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelash" target="_blank" title="Eyelash" rel="noopener noreferrer">eyelashes</a>, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyelid" title="Eyelid">eyelids</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin" target="_blank" title="Skin" rel="noopener noreferrer">skin</a>, hair is a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth#Hair-growth_stimulants" target="_blank" title="Stratified squamous epithelium" rel="noopener noreferrer">stratified squamous</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin" target="_blank" title="Keratin" rel="noopener noreferrer">keratinized</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelium" title="Epithelium">epithelium</a> made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_filament" title="Protein filament">filaments</a> provide structure and strength to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair" target="_blank" title="Hair shaft" rel="noopener noreferrer">hair shaft</a>.</p>
<p>Hair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and <b>concurrent</b> phases: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle" target="_blank" title="Anagen" rel="noopener noreferrer">anagen</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth#Catagen_phase" target="_blank" title="Catagen" rel="noopener noreferrer">catagen</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle#Telogen_phase" target="_blank" title="Telogen" rel="noopener noreferrer">telogen</a> phases. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur simultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another is in the telogen phase.</p>
<p>The body has different types of hair, including <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair" target="_blank" title="Vellus hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">vellus hair</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_hair" target="_blank" title="Androgenic hair" rel="noopener noreferrer">androgenic hair</a>, each with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth and protection. Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair.</p>
